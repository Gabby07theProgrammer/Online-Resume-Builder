# Remaining Fixes Needed

The following issues still need to be addressed in `process.php`:

1. Replace the SQL query execution in the update section (line 20):
```php
// Change this:
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {

// To this:
if (empty($newUsername) || empty($newEmail)) {
    echo "Username and email cannot be empty!";
    exit();
}
if ($stmt->execute()) {
```

2. Replace the SQL query execution in the delete section (line 36):
```php
// Change this:
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {

// To this:
if ($stmt->execute()) {
```

These changes are necessary because:
- We switched from using raw SQL queries to prepared statements for better security
- We need to validate that username and email are not empty before processing the update
- The `$sql` variable no longer exists since we're using prepared statements

The account.php file appears to be working correctly with the proper parameter binding and session handling.
